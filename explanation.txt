task 2. Installing yii2
According to this task - was installed Yii2 framework and created a project. This project is in archive basic.zip.
But I faced with the issue during running this project locally. Once I wrote a command in a terminal 
“php -S localhost:8000" 
and typed the url "http://localhost:8000" in a browser - I saw the issue on a web-page:
 "The requested source '/' was not found" (please find the appropriated screenshots in a folder "screenshots")

task 3. SEO optimization
I created a simple html-page with the seo-rules. Please find this index.html file in a folder "seo-optimization"

task 4. Mobile layout adaptation
I downloaded the whole page (with pictures, css-files and scripts) as much as was possible and changed for mobile screens only the heading h2 (on the top of the page).
The rest website elements were adapted for mobiles correctly (in my opinion). I tested responsive design for several screen resolutions - it works correctly.
Please find this landing in a folder "mobileview".
