<ol><li>Mobile-Friendly Design: With the increasing use of mobile devices for browsing, having a mobile-friendly layout is crucial for SEO optimization. It ensures that your website loads quickly, looks good, and is easy to navigate on mobile devices, which can positively impact your search engine rankings.</li>

<li>Clear and Descriptive URL Structure: A well-optimized URL structure that includes relevant keywords can help search engines understand the content of your web pages. It also makes it easier for users to navigate your website and share links, which can improve your SEO.</li>

<li>Proper Use of Heading Tags: Properly using heading tags (H1, H2, H3, etc.) in your layout can help search engines understand the hierarchy and structure of your content. This makes it easier for them to determine the relevance and importance of your content, which can positively impact your SEO.</li>

<li>Strategic Keyword Placement: Placing relevant keywords strategically in your layout, such as in the title tag, meta description, headings, and throughout your content, can help search engines understand the topic and relevance of your content. However, it's important to avoid keyword stuffing, as it can negatively impact your SEO.</li>

<li>Tag Title with the naming of each page is mandatory.</li>

<li>Lists should be wrapped in the appropriated tags 'ul' or 'ol'(for numerated lists).</li>

<li>Each picture should have an alt tag with the appropriated short description of this picture.</li>

<li>High-Quality Content: Creating high-quality, original, and engaging content that provides value to users is a fundamental element of SEO optimization. A well-optimized layout should include ample space for high-quality content, including text, images, videos, and other media.</li>

<li>Optimized Images: Images can enhance the visual appeal of your website, but they can also slow down your website's loading speed if they are not optimized. Optimizing images by compressing them, using descriptive file names and alt tags, and ensuring they are properly sized can improve your website's performance and SEO.</li>

<li>User-Friendly Navigation: A clear and user-friendly navigation menu helps both users and search engines easily navigate your website. A well-optimized layout should have a logical and intuitive navigation structure that allows users to find what they're looking for quickly and easily, which can positively impact your SEO.</li>

<li>Fast Loading Speed: Website loading speed is an important factor in SEO, as it can impact user experience and search engine rankings. Optimizing your layout for fast loading speed by minimizing CSS and JavaScript files, optimizing images, and using caching techniques can improve your website's performance and SEO.</li>

<li>Social Media Integration: Integrating social media sharing buttons and links in your layout can encourage users to share your content on social media, which can help increase your website's visibility and reach. Social media signals can also indirectly impact your SEO rankings.</li>

<li>Schema Markup: Implementing schema markup, also known as structured data, in your layout can help search engines understand the content and context of your website better. This can result in rich snippets in search results, which can improve click-through rates and SEO rankings.</li>

<li>A special page Site map</li>

<li>HTML, CSS, JS, etc code should be in the appropriated files. To include css, js code to the html-page is deprecated according to SEO-rules.</li>
